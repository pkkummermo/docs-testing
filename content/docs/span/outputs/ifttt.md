# IFTTT

The [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) output is suitable for experiments and simple automation. The delivery
is on a best-effort basis and isn't guaranteed but it makes it simple to build
proof-of-concept automation without any programming experience.

## Format

The `value1` field set to the received payload and the `value2` field is set to
the device ID.
